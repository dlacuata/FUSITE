            Our 10-week internship program enables interns to shadow three board positions of their 
            choice. The first six weeks involve rotating through these roles, followed by a focus on one 
            preferred position during the final four weeks, culminating in an intern-led general meeting in 
            the last week. Interns are expected to attend both general meetings and board meetings 
            throughout the program.
